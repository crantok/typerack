# The idea

Some typing tutor software can only get you so far. Maybe it tutors you in touch typing all the letters but leaves out the numbers or letters. Maybe its limited number of lessons become repetitive and give diminishing returns. Maybe it just ain't that good for typing your language of choice. Typerack will pick up where those typing tutors stop.


# Current features

 - Uummm.


# Planned features

 - You will be able to load any text file and practice typing its contents.
 - You will be able to select different kinds of error highlighting to suit different goals (speed versus accuracy).
 - And you will be able to choose how to treat all that pesky white space in code files.


# Note

Typerack will not be a tutor. It is intended to give you the chance to practice your touch typing skills, and track your progress, using content that is relevant to you.
